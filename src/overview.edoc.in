@doc <p>RabbitMQ gateway for ejabberd.</p>

== Introduction ==

</div>

The {@link mod_rabbitmq} module implements an <a
href="http://www.process-one.net/en/ejabberd/">ejabberd</a> extension
module which gateways AMQP (as implemented by <a
href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/">RabbitMQ</a>) to XMPP.

By bridging between the two systems, we benefit from:

<ul>
  <li>XMPP's internet-scale addressing and federation</li>
  <li>XMPP's presence model</li>
  <li>AMQP's store-and-forward capability</li>
  <li>AMQP's routing and filtering (using <i>exchanges</i> and <i>bindings</i>)</li>
</ul>

The current implementation is a very simple mapping between the two
systems. Its simplicity keeps the code short, but only exposes a
subset of AMQP features to the XMPP network, and vice versa.

== Basic Operation ==

The services provided by a mod_rabbitmq gateway are accessed by
ordinary XMPP accounts registered with normal XMPP servers taking part
in the global XMPP network, including

<ul>
  <li>end-users running desktop XMPP IM clients</li>
  <li>embedded services acting as XMPP bots</li>
  <li>other gateways and network services</li>
</ul>

The AMQP resources managed by the gateway are also accessible as usual
via the AMQP protocol.

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="xmpp-amqp-gateway.png" alt="Illustration of example AMQP/XMPP network">
</img>
</div>

In the example illustration above,

<ul>

  <li>Both <tt>romeo@montague.net</tt> and <tt>juliet@capulet.com</tt>
  have subscribed to presence announcements for (i.e. become IM
  buddies with) <tt>pubsub@dev.rabbitmq.com</tt>.</li>

  <li>Note that "<tt>pubsub</tt>" is just an example exchange name!
  Any exchange name is possible. AMQP is a bit different to both XMPP
  multi-user chat and XMPP pub-sub; see also "Limitations" below.</li>

  <li>XMPP messages sent to <tt>pubsub@dev.rabbitmq.com</tt> are
  routed through the AMQP "pubsub" exchange to any bound queues --
  including those of any XMPP JIDs that are buddies with the AMQP
  exchange.</li>

  <li>Any AMQP messages sent to the "pubsub" exchange are of course
  routed similarly.</li>

  <li>In the diagram, <tt>juliet</tt> is online, but <tt>romeo</tt> is
  offline (unavailable). The system is therefore running a consumer
  process which consumes from <tt>juliet</tt>'s queue, sending her the
  messages it contains. The queue for <tt>romeo</tt> continues to
  buffer messages until he is next online.</li>

</ul>

== JIDs Map to Exchanges ==

Each exchange in the AMQP virtual host is given a JID. For example,
the JID "<tt>test@dev.rabbitmq.com</tt>" resolves to the exchange
named "<tt>test</tt>" within the virtual host that the gateway
represents.

Queues are not currently given JIDs; instead, they're created and
deleted on demand by the action of either direct AMQP commands, or by
XMPP subscription management (see below).

Messages sent via XMPP to an exchange's JID are routed and delivered
as per normal AMQP rules.

== Presence Subscription Controls Queue Creation and Binding ==

Whenever a JID in the global XMPP network subscribes to presence
notifications of an exchange JID managed by the gateway, the exchange
subscribes back. Once the subscription process is complete, a queue is
created for the remote JID (if one does not already exist), and the
queue is then bound to the exchange. For example:

<ul>

  <li><tt>romeo@montague.net</tt> knows that on
  <tt>dev.rabbitmq.com</tt> there's an exchange called
  <tt>test</tt>.</li>

  <li>He uses his XMPP client to add <tt>test@dev.rabbitmq.com</tt> to
  his buddy list.</li>

  <li>The mod_rabbitmq gateway at <tt>dev.rabbitmq.com</tt>
  effectively adds <tt>romeo@montague.net</tt> to the roster for
  the <tt>test</tt> exchange.</li>

  <li>The gateway then creates a local queue named
  "<tt>romeo@montague.net</tt>", and binds it to the "test"
  exchange.</li>

</ul>

If <tt>romeo</tt> later subscribes to another exchange managed by the
same gateway, the same queue is reused. Deliveries for each exchange
subscribed to are all placed on the single queue responsible for the
remote JID "<tt>romeo@montague.net</tt>".

If <tt>romeo</tt> later unsubscribes from all exchanges managed by the
gateway, so that no subscriptions/bindings are left for his queue, the
queue is deleted.

== Presence Controls Consumers and Deliveries ==

Because the gateway has subscribed to <tt>romeo</tt>'s presence
status, it will hear about his presence changes. When he comes online,
an AMQP consumer is started, which reads from his queue, delivering
each queued-up message as an instant message. When he goes offline,
the consumer is stopped, and messages are buffered in the AMQP queue
as usual for later consumption.

== JID Resources are used as Routing Keys and Binding Patterns ==

XMPP's JIDs have three parts: <tt>name@dns.host/resource</tt>.

<ul>

  <li><tt>name</tt> is a local part, unique within a server.</li>

  <li><tt>dns.host</tt> is a globally-unique DNS name, used to
  identify a server.</li>

  <li><tt>resource</tt> is an (optional!) sub-name for identifying any
  one of a number of endpoints that are controlled by and represent
  <tt>name@dns.host</tt>.</li>

</ul>

In the current AMQP-to-XMPP binding, the <tt>resource</tt> part of the
JID is used as the <i>AMQP routing key</i> when delivering messages,
and the <i>AMQP binding pattern</i> when subscribing and
unsubscribing.

This means that:

<ul>

  <li>If <tt>romeo@montague.net</tt> subscribes to
  <tt>amq.topic@dev.rabbitmq.com/*.ibm</tt>, he will receive messages
  that have AMQP routing key "nyse.ibm" or "lse.ibm", but not
  "ibm.foo" or "nyse.msft", because <tt>amq.topic</tt> is an AMQP
  topic exchange.</li>

  <li>The other kinds of exchange -- direct and fanout -- also use the
  <tt>resource</tt> part of the subscribed-to JID as a binding key,
  filtering as per their definition in the AMQP specification.</li>

  <li><tt>amq.topic</tt> messages routed to <tt>romeo</tt> will appear
  to come from <tt>amq.topic@dev.rabbitmq.com/nyse.ibm</tt>,
  <tt>amq.topic@dev.rabbitmq.com/lse.ibm</tt>, etc; the AMQP
  routing-key of the message being delivered is placed in the
  <tt>resource</tt> part of the sending JID.</li>

  <li>XMPP messages sent to <tt>exchange@dev.rabbitmq.com/foo</tt> are
  delivered into the AMQP layer with exchange name "<tt>exchange</tt>"
  and routing key "<tt>foo</tt>".</li>

</ul>

== Support for XMPP Discovery ==

The gateway implements the <a
href="http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0030.html">XMPP Service
Discovery</a> protocol to permit discovery of exposed exchanges.

== Interacting with the RabbitMQ-XMPP Bot ==

Since the "name" part of a JID is technically optional, the current
implementation makes use of this by reserving bare, domain-only JIDs
for use in addressing a built-in XMPP bot that controls exchange
creation and deletion.

The bot speaks a high-level command-line based language for creating,
listing and deleting exchanges. If, for example, a mod_rabbitmq
instance is configured to be responsible for the JIDs within the
domain <tt>dev.rabbitmq.com</tt>, then the associated bot will be
addressable at the bare JID <tt>dev.rabbitmq.com</tt> itself.

The reason we took the unusual step of giving a chat-capable actor a
bare JID address was that it neatly avoids the need to reserve special
names that would otherwise arise. For example, we might have named the
bot "bot@dev.rabbitmq.com", but what would then have happened if a
user created an AMQP exchange named "bot"?

== Creating, Listing and Deleting Exchanges ==

Given a mod_rabbitmq instance responsible for
<tt>dev.rabbitmq.com</tt>, the following interaction, between the two
JIDs <tt>romeo@montague.net</tt> and <tt>dev.rabbitmq.com</tt> (note
again the bare JID, without a "name@" part!) shows the instance's bot
in action:

<pre>
[18:12:05] &lt;romeo&gt; help
[18:12:06] &lt;dev.rabbitmq.com&gt; Here is a list of commands. Use 'help (command)' to get details on any one.
["help","exchange.declare","exchange.delete","bind","unbind","list"]
[18:12:12] &lt;romeo&gt; list
[18:12:12] &lt;dev.rabbitmq.com&gt; Exchanges available:
[{"mandatoryTestExchange",fanout,transient,[]},
 {"canvaspainter",fanout,durable,[]},
 {"sam",fanout,transient,[]},
 {"amq.rabbitmq.log",topic,durable,[]},
 {"rabbit",fanout,durable,[]},
 {"test",fanout,durable,[]},
 {"test completion",fanout,transient,[]},
 {"amq.topic",topic,durable,[]},
 {"amq.direct",direct,durable,[]},
 {"amq.fanout",fanout,durable,[]}]
[18:13:05] &lt;romeo&gt; help exchange.declare
[18:13:05] &lt;dev.rabbitmq.com&gt; 'exchange.declare (name) [-type (type)] [-transient]'. Creates a new AMQP exchange.
[18:13:14] &lt;romeo&gt; exchange.declare foo -type fanout
[18:13:14] &lt;dev.rabbitmq.com&gt; Exchange "foo" of type fanout declared. Now you can subscribe to it.
[18:13:19] &lt;romeo&gt; help exchange.delete
[18:13:19] &lt;dev.rabbitmq.com&gt; 'exchange.delete (name)'. Deletes an AMQP exchange.
[18:13:23] &lt;romeo&gt; exchange.delete foo
[18:13:23] &lt;dev.rabbitmq.com&gt; Exchange "foo" deleted.
</pre>

== Compiling the gateway ==

To compile the gateway,

<ol>

  <li><a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html">Download</a>, <a
  href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/build.html">compile</a> and install
  the RabbitMQ server, so that it is available in
  <tt>/usr/lib/erlang/lib/</tt> (path may vary by operating system)
  just as any other Erlang library.</li>

  <li><a
  href="http://www.process-one.net/en/ejabberd/downloads">Download</a>
  (or check out from subversion) ejabberd.</li>

  <li>Copy (or symlink) <tt>src/mod_rabbitmq.erl</tt> into your
  <tt>ejabberd/src</tt> directory, so that it exists alongside such
  ejabberd source files as <tt>mod_echo.erl</tt>,
  <tt>mod_offline.erl</tt> etc.</li>

  <li>Compile and install the ejabberd server from the source
  tree.</li>

</ol>

Once ejabberd is compiled and installed, configure it as you usually
would, and proceed with the next section.

== Configuring a mod_rabbitmq Instance ==

Each mod_rabbitmq instance in a running ejabberd maps to a single AMQP
"virtual host" running within a RabbitMQ instance: a collection of
exchanges, queues, and the bindings between them. The instance is
given responsibility for a single DNS domain: for example, JIDs ending
with <tt>@dev.rabbitmq.com</tt> map to a mod_rabbitmq instance.

Currently, only a single mod_rabbitmq can run within each ejabberd
node.

To enable the gateway, decide on the DNS name that is to map to the
AMQP virtual host, and edit <tt>/etc/ejabberd/ejabberd.cfg</tt> to
include a <tt>{mod_rabbitmq,[]}</tt> stanza in its <tt>modules</tt>
section:

<pre>
{modules,
 [
  {mod_adhoc,    []},
  ...
  <b>{mod_rabbitmq, []},</b>
  ...
  {mod_version,  []}
 ]}.
</pre>

== Limitations ==

The current implementation is largely a proof-of-concept.

There is no support for the XMPP Multi-User Chat protocol.

There is no support for the XMPP Pub-Sub protocol.

A more sophisticated mapping would give JIDs to queues as well as exchanges.

Only plain-text IM-style messages and chats are routed across the
gateway at present. Other media types are not supported.

There is no support for message-receipt acknowledgement (AMQP's
"basic.ack" operation).

The command protocol (understood by the XMPP bot built in to the
gateway) is ridiculous. It should be mechanically generated from the
AMQP specification itself (possibly augmented with extension methods).
